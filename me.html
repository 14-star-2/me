        These are two of my fellow sqaush players who play squash with me! I have many people who plays squash. Squash is fun to play and is a interactive sport on and off the court.
        I have often said that sqaush is like raquet ball and wall ball combined. At sqaush smarts, we have 2 main sessions: Acadamics and Squash. I have played squash for about 5 years now. At  this program, we play squash and do fitness for an hour. After that, we would go to academies. In the classrooms, we would do homework and/or do some kind of assignment that the academics director has for us.
